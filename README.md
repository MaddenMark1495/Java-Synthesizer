# Synthesizer
A Modern Synthesizer written in Java

This version lets you play the piano and two other instruments. Drums and a mystery instrument. The mystery instrument is  randomly chosen. To start click start on main menu, then you are free to play from there. Instruments are listed on the bottom. 

**NOTE**
I am starting over from the beginning. The overall UI is going to be change to handle more instruments and recording. Plugging in MIDI instruments is going to take more time.
